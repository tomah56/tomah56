# Here is my projects I wroked on:
## 42 projects
### [42 Survival Game](https://github.com/tomah56/42_survivalgame)

_I designed and coded a little 2D game where you have to run away from the black hole, collect some evaluation points and arrive safely to the moulinet. If that sounds familiar that means you are also a 42 student._

### [Cube3D](https://github.com/tomah56/cube3D)

_[Olawale]() and me created a small 3D game. Based on the a very famous [Wolfenstein_3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D). Learned about [Ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) and game developing._

### [Mini-shell](https://github.com/tomah56/minishell)

_[Sonja]() and I coded a small bash-like shell in C. Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and much more._

### [Webserv](https://github.com/tomah56/42-webserv) 

_Together with my peers [Alice](https://github.com/akamlah) and [Olawale](https://github.com/Sirelaw), we created a HTTP web server in C++. We used Nginx as a reference, and our server is following the HTTP/1.1 standard._

### [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/tomah56/ft_transcendence)

_Final project of the 42 Heilbronn curriculum. [doreshev](https://github.com/doreshev), [pweinstock](https://github.com/pweinstock) and me created a fully functional website with frontend, backend and database.
Users will need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play our reinterpretation of the game [Pong (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) agains each other, spectate an ongoing game, chat with other users or browse through user profiles and the highscore board._

## hackathons
### [Get Next Line Gamified](https://github.com/tomah56/42_hackatlon)

_In our first in-haus 42 hackathon we got the challenge to make our school better. I had the idea for helping the students go through our projects in the form of a game. [ALf](https://github.com/alfjl), [Fredi](https://github.com/Fredi-B), [Jakob](https://github.com/jweeeezy), [Kerem](https://github.com/K-isikoglu) and me in 24 hours finished our first MVP._ 

### [Satelite Control](https://github.com/tomah56/leanspace_-hackathon)

_A hackathon organised by [LeanSpace](https://leanspace.io/) Our task was to build a web app to control satellites. Using their API and automating the process for the users. The user says which coordinates and the system should calculate and search for the most optimal satellite choice (the best accuracy/reaching time)._

## My own projects
### [Webpages](https://github.com/tomah56/tamas.a.tokesi.github.io)

_Some of my early webdevolping projets._

### [42 c++ Project Starter](https://github.com/tomah56/cppProjectStarter)

_In 42 while you learn c++ you have to write a lot of classes. To make that process easier I designed (actually one of my first c++ projects) a little application that automates the class making. It saved me a lot of time during the exercises._

### [AhriO](https://github.com/tomah56/kalleweb)

_I was part of the [Talent Scolarship](https://campusfounders.de/talent/talent-scholarship-program/) at Campus Founders as part of my entrepreneurial journey I designed a web page for my Startup._

## other
### [Night of Science](https://github.com/tomah56/nightscience)

_A small art and coding project [Tobi](https://github.com/tobbel42) [Jakob](https://github.com/jweeeezy) and I participated with the help of [bleeptrack](https://github.com/bleeptrack). Created motion based instalaltion for the Nigth of Science event in Heilbronn._
