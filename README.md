# Here is my projects I wroked on:
### [Cube3D](https://github.com/tomah56/cube3D)
[Olawale]() and me created a small 3D game. Based on the a very famous [Wolfenstein_3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D). Learned about [Ray_casting]([Wolfenstein_3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting)) and game developing. 
### [minishell](https://github.com/tomah56/minishell)
[Sonja]() and I coded a small bash-like shell in C. Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and much more.
### [webserv]() 
Together with my peers [Alice]() and [Olawale](), we created a HTTP web server in C++. We used Nginx as a reference, and our server is following the HTTP/1.1 standard.
### [ft_transcendence]()
[doreshev](https://github.com/doreshev), [pweinstock]() and me created a fully functional website with frontend, backend and database.
Users will need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play our reinterpretation of the game [Pong (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) agains each other, spectate an ongoing game, chat with other users or browse through user profiles and the highscore board.
