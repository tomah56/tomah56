## [minishell](https://github.com/tomah56/minishell) [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,bash)](https://skillicons.dev)
[Sonja]() and I coded a small bash-like shell in C. Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and much more.
## [webserv]() [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,nginx,html)](https://skillicons.dev)
Together with my peers [Alice]() and [Olawale](), I created a HTTP web server in C++. We used Nginx as a reference, and our server is following the HTTP/1.1 standard. In this project, I learned a lot about the HTTP protocol, multithreading vs multiplexing and the use of sockets.

[doreshev](https://github.com/doreshev), []() and me created a fully functional website with frontend, backend and database.
Users will need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play our reinterpretation of the game [Pong (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) agains each other, spectate an ongoing game, chat with other users or browse through user profiles and the highscore board.
